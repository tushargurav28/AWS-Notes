## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing. It provides:

- Provisioning of exactly the right type and size of computing resources.
- Access to as many resources as needed, almost instantly.
- A simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a set of application services.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) owns and maintains the network-connected hardware, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.


### The Deployment Models of the Cloud

| **Private Cloud**                                                        | **Public Cloud**                                                                                         | **Hybrid Cloud**                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. | Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, delivered over the Internet. | Keep some servers on-premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud.     |
| Complete control over data, security, and compliance.                    | Cost-effective as infrastructure is shared among multiple users.                                         | Allows data and applications to be shared between private and public clouds. |
| Security for sensitive applications, ideal for critical workloads.       | Suitable for less sensitive workloads that require high scalability and availability.                    | Offers flexibility, security, and scalability for different use cases.       |
| Meet specific business needs and compliance requirements.                | No maintenance required as the cloud provider manages the infrastructure.                                | Provides business continuity, disaster recovery, and data backup solutions.  |

### Pricing of the Cloud – Quick Overview
AWS follows three fundamental pricing principles based on the pay-as-you-go pricing model:

| **Fundamental**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compute**           | Pay for the compute time you consume. Examples include EC2 instance hours or Lambda invocation duration.                                                             |
| **Storage**           | Pay for the amount of data stored in the cloud. Examples include S3 storage space and EBS volume usage.                                                              |
| **Data Transfer OUT** | Pay for data transfer out of the cloud. Data transfer IN is free. This pricing structure solves the issue of expensive data transfer fees in traditional IT systems. |

### How Cloud Pricing Solves Traditional IT Cost Issues
- Traditional IT requires expensive upfront investments for hardware, maintenance, and upgrades.
- With AWS's pay-as-you-go model, you only pay for what you use, reducing overall costs.
- You can scale up or down based on demand, minimizing under-utilized resources.

### AWS Cloud Use Cases
1. **Web Hosting**: Host websites with elastic scaling and high availability.
2. **Big Data Analytics**: Run analytics on large datasets.
3. **Application Hosting**: Host applications with global accessibility and automated scaling.
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Implement disaster recovery strategies with minimized infrastructure.
5. **Backup and Storage**: Store backups in a highly durable and secure manner.

### AWS Regions
- Geographically isolated areas where AWS clusters data centers.
- Each region has multiple Availability Zones.
- Used to deploy applications close to customers for lower latency.

### How to Choose an AWS Region?
- **Latency**: Choose a region closest to your customers for lower latency.
- **Compliance**: Ensure the region meets data residency and compliance requirements.
- **Services Available**: Check which AWS services are offered in the region.
- **Pricing**: Prices vary by region, so choose a region that fits your cost requirements.
### AWS Availability Zones (AZs)
- Multiple, isolated data centers within a region.
- Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and networking.
- Provides redundancy and fault tolerance in case of a failure.
- They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
### AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
- Network locations that deliver content closer to end users.
- Used by services like Amazon CloudFront and AWS Global Accelerator.
- Provides low latency and improved performance for content delivery.

## AWS Shared Responsibility Model
### What is the Shared Responsibility Model?

- AWS and the customer share responsibility for security and compliance.
- Divides security tasks based on **AWS as the provider** and **customer as the user** of cloud services.
### AWS Responsibilities: **Security _of_ the Cloud**
- AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all services offered in the AWS Cloud.
- Includes hardware, software, networking, and facilities:
    - **Physical security** of data centers (e.g., access control, environmental controls).
    - **Infrastructure** security, such as maintaining hypervisors, host operating systems, and network infrastructure.
    - **Global network** operations, such as DDoS protection and monitoring.
### Customer Responsibilities: **Security _in_ the Cloud**
- Customers are responsible for managing and securing what they put in the cloud.
- Includes:
    - **Data protection**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
    - **IAM**: Control access through Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, users, and policies.
    - **OS and application configurations**: Maintain security of guest operating systems, applications, and firewall configurations.
    - **Network settings**: Manage security group rules and network access control lists (NACLs).
    - **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with regulations and standards based on data storage and usage.


### Example Responsibilities for Different AWS Services

|**Service Type**|**AWS Responsibility**|**Customer Responsibility**|
|---|---|---|
|**IaaS (e.g., EC2)**|Securing physical infrastructure, hypervisor, and network.|Configure and secure OS, patch management, data, and network settings.|
|**PaaS (e.g., RDS)**|Managing the database engine, backups, and patching.|Secure data at rest and in transit, manage DB access, and IAM roles.|
|**SaaS (e.g., S3)**|Protecting the service's underlying infrastructure.|Manage permissions, bucket policies, and data lifecycle rules.|

### Summary

- AWS handles security _of_ the cloud, while customers manage security _in_ the cloud.
- Understanding your responsibilities helps you implement appropriate security measures for your AWS environment.
