## Scalability & High Availability

- **Scalability**: Ability of a system to handle an increase in load by adapting to the demand.
- **High Availability**: Ensures a system is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, often achieved by reducing the impact of failures.
- There are two kinds of scalability:
    - Vertical Scalability
    - Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

## Vertical Scalability

- Increasing the capacity of a single instance (e.g., moving from t3.medium to t3.large).
- Suitable for databases or applications where upgrading a single resource is more efficient.
- Limited by hardware constraints (can only scale up to a certain point).

## Horizontal Scalability

- Adding more instances (servers) to distribute the load across multiple resources.
- Achieved through technologies like **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** and **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**.
- Preferred for applications needing resilience and distributed workloads.
- Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems.

## High Availability

- Implemented by deploying resources across multiple **Availability Zones** (AZs).
- Ensures failover and redundancy in case of failures in one AZ.
- High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling

## High Availability & Scalability for EC2

- Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
    - From: t2.nano - 0.5G of RAM, 1 vCPU
    - To: u-12tb1.metal – 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
- Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (= scale out / in)
    - Auto Scaling Group
    - Load Balancer
- High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
    - Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
    - Load Balancer multi AZ

## Scalability vs Elasticity (vs Agility)

| **Term**        | **Definition**                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability** | Ability to increase or decrease the capacity to handle varying levels of traffic or load.                         |
| **Elasticity**  | Automatically adjusts resources up or down based on the load in real-time, preventing under or over-provisioning. |
| **Agility**     | The ability to deploy and manage resources quickly and efficiently in response to changing demands.               |

## What is Load Balancing?

- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) to ensure that no single resource is overwhelmed.

### Why Use a Load Balancer?

- Ensures application fault tolerance and high availability by spreading the load across multiple servers.
- Protects against failures in a single resource by rerouting traffic automatically.
- Do regular health checks to your instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites

### Why Use an Elastic Load Balancer?

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** is a fully managed service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets in one or more Availability Zones.
- It improves fault tolerance, enhances performance, and scales according to demand.
- AWS guarantees that it will be working
- AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
- AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

#### Types of ELB

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: For HTTP and HTTPS traffic, operates at Layer 7 (application level).
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Handles high-performance traffic at Layer 4 (transport level).
3. **Classic Load Balancer**: (slowly retiring) – Layer 4 & 7

## What’s an Auto Scaling Group?

- An **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** ensures the right number of EC2 instances are running to handle the load.
- Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on metrics such as CPU utilization or custom-defined thresholds.
- Can span across multiple AZs to ensure high availability.
- In real-life, the load on your websites and application can change
- In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
- The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
    - Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
    - Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
    - Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
    - Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
    - Replace unhealthy instances
- Cost Savings: only run at an optimal capacity (principle of the cloud)

### Auto Scaling Group Scaling Strategies

- **Manual Scaling**: Adjusting the number of instances manually based on load prediction.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand (e.g., CPU usage).
    - Simple / Step Scaling
        - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
        - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
    - Target Tracking Scaling
        - Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
    - Scheduled Scaling
        - Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
        - Example: increase the min. capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays
- **Predictive Scaling**: Uses machine learning to predict future traffic patterns and scales proactively.

- Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
    - Implement Elasticity for your application, across multiple AZ
    - Scale EC2 instances based on the demand on your system, replace unhealthy
    - Integrated with the ELB
