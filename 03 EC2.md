## What is Amazon EC2?

- **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a scalable compute service that allows users to rent virtual servers in the cloud.
- It provides flexibility to scale compute resources up or down based on demand, offering a cost-effective solution for applications with variable workloads.
- Key features include:
    - **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second, with no long-term commitments.
    - **Reserved Instances**: Make a one-time payment for a significant discount on instance usage over a one- or three-year term.
    - **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at a potentially lower price, allowing cost savings for flexible workloads.

### EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options

- EC2 allows for customized sizing and configurations, which include:
    - **Instance Type**: Selecting the appropriate type based on the application's performance requirements.
    - **Storage Options**: Using Amazon EBS for persistent block storage or instance store for temporary storage.
    - **Networking**: Configuring VPCs, subnets, and security groups to control access and manage traffic.
    - **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to enhance availability and fault tolerance.
    - **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusting the number of instances based on demand, ensuring the application has the necessary resources.

### EC2 User Data

- **User data** is a powerful feature for automating the setup of EC2 instances.
- It can be specified at instance launch and is executed on the instance when it first boots.
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is **only run once** at the instance **first start**
- **Common use cases include**:
    - Installing software packages (e.g., `yum install httpd -y` for Apache).
    - Downloading configuration files or scripts from Amazon S3.
    - Configuring system settings and services (e.g., starting an application server).
### EC2 Instance Types - Overview

Amazon EC2 offers a variety of instance types, each designed to meet specific application requirements.([https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/))
#### General Purpose Instances

## Introduction to Security Groups
- **Security Groups** are **virtual firewalls** that control inbound and outbound traffic to Amazon EC2 instances.
- They act at the instance level, not the subnet level, and provide a way to manage access to resources within a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
- Security groups can be associated with multiple instances and can be modified at any time, allowing for flexible management of network access.
- **Key Features**:
    - By default, all inbound traffic is denied, and all outbound traffic is allowed.
    - You can specify rules based on protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP), port number, and source IP address or CIDR block.
### Common Use Cases
- Restricting access to an application server (allowing only specific IPs).
- Allowing traffic from specific ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS).
- Isolating database instances from public access.
## Deeper Dive
- **Inbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed into your instances.
- **Outbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed out from your instances.
- Each rule includes:
    - **Type**: The protocol used (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
    - **Protocol**: The protocol number (TCP = 6, UDP = 17).
    - **Port Range**: The port(s) affected by the rule.
    - **Source/Destination**: The IP address or CIDR range from which traffic is allowed.
### Security Groups Diagram

### Examples of Security Group Rules

|**Rule Type**|**Protocol**|**Port Range**|**Source/Destination**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Inbound Rule|TCP|22|203.0.113.0/24 (SSH Access)|
|Inbound Rule|TCP|80|0.0.0.0/0 (HTTP Access)|
|Outbound Rule|All Traffic|All|0.0.0.0/0|

### Good to Know

- **Limits**: Each security group can have up to 60 inbound and 60 outbound rules by default (this limit can be increased by requesting through AWS Support).
- **Default Security Group**: When you create a VPC, a default security group is automatically created, which allows all outbound traffic and denies all inbound traffic by default.
- **Multiple Security Groups**: You can assign multiple security groups to a single EC2 instance, enabling fine-grained control over traffic.
- **Security Best Practices**:
    - Apply the principle of least privilege (only allow necessary traffic).
    - Regularly review and audit security group rules.
    - Use descriptive names and tags for easy management.

## Classic Ports to Know

|**Port Number**|**Protocol**|**Service**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|
|20|TCP|FTP (Data Transfer)|Used for transferring files over FTP.|
|21|TCP|FTP (Control)|Used for controlling file transfer sessions.|
|22|TCP|SSH|Secure Shell for secure logins and command execution.|
|80|TCP|HTTP|Hypertext Transfer Protocol for web traffic.|
|443|TCP|HTTPS|Secure HTTP for secure web traffic.|
|3389|TCP|RDP|Used for Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing users to connect to and control remote Windows machines.|
